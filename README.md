# Latin Epub Project

There are a lot of works of latin poetry, but it's sometimes difficult to find them with macrons, and in epub format for easy viewing.
Hence, the goal of this repository is to make them more accessible.

All macrons have been added by the online latin macronizer found here: https://alatius.com/macronizer/
This is an automatic service, so it might not be entirely accurate.
If you are proficient in Latin, and have noticed a mistake in the macronization of a particular work, feel free to submit a pull request with the mistake fixed.

I hope you find this repository useful!
